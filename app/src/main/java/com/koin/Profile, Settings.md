Here is a summary of the changes I made:


1. The "Edit Profile" functionality has been moved to its own dedicated screen.
2. The profile screen now only displays the user's watchlist, and the user's name is shown in the top bar.
3. The settings screen now contains a link to the new "Edit Profile" screen.


The app is ready to be run. Is there anything else I can help you with?

This document outlines the recent changes made to the Koin application, focusing on the refactoring of the user profile and settings screens.


1. Profile Screen Refactoring

The profile screen has been significantly refactored to improve user experience and code organization.

1.1. Removal of the Pager


The HorizontalPager and the associated tab layout have been removed from the ProfileScreen. The screen now exclusively displays the user's watchlist, providing a more focused and streamlined view.

1.2. Dynamic Top Bar Title

The top bar of the profile screen now dynamically displays the user's name, offering a more personalized experience.

Before:



    1 TopAppBar(
    2     title = {
    3         Row(verticalAlignment = Alignment.CenterVertically) {
    4             if (user.avatarUri != null) {
    5                 AsyncImage(
    6                     model = user.avatarUri,
    7                     modifier = Modifier
    8                         .size(32.dp)
    9                         .clip(RoundedCornerShape(16.dp)),
10                     contentDescription = null,
11                     contentScale = ContentScale.Crop
12                 )
13             } else {
14                 Icon(
15                     Icons.Default.AccountCircle,
16                     contentDescription = null,
17                     modifier = Modifier.size(32.dp)
18                 )
19             }
20             Spacer(modifier = Modifier.width(8.dp))
21         }
22     },
23     // ...
24 )


After:


1 TopAppBar(
2     title = { Text(user.name) },
3     // ...
4 )


2. Dedicated Edit Profile Screen

The "Edit Profile" functionality has been extracted from the ProfileScreen and moved into its own dedicated screen, EditProfileScreen.kt. This separation of concerns improves code maintainability and allows for a more focused
user interface for editing profile information.


The EditProfileScreen is accessible from the SettingsScreen.

3. Settings Screen Enhancements

The SettingsScreen has been updated to provide access to the new EditProfileScreen and to house the logout functionality.

3.1. Navigation to Edit Profile


A clickable box has been added to the SettingsScreen that allows users to navigate to the EditProfileScreen.


1 Box(
2     modifier = Modifier
3         .fillMaxWidth()
4         .clickable { navController.navigate("edit_profile") }
5         .padding(16.dp)
6 ) {
7     Text("Edit Profile")
8 }



3.2. Logout Functionality

The logout functionality has been moved from the ProfileScreen to the SettingsScreen. A SettingsViewModel has been created to handle the logout logic, which includes clearing the user's session from the SessionManager.

4. Top Bar Icon Changes


4.1. Portfolio Screen Icon

The profile icon in the PortfolioScreen top bar has been replaced with the app's launcher icon.

4.2. Profile Screen Icon


The "more" icon in the ProfileScreen top bar has been replaced with a "settings" icon, which directly navigates to the SettingsScreen.

5. Navigation Graph Updates


The navigation graph in NavGraph.kt and the Screen.kt sealed class have been updated to include the new EditProfileScreen and to reflect the changes in navigation flow.
