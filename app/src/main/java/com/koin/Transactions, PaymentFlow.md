Here's a summary of the documentation of the changes we've made:

New Features Implemented


* Transaction Card and Transaction Detail Screen:
    * Implemented a new UI component (TransactionCard) to display a summary of individual transactions.
    * Created a dedicated screen (TransactionDetailScreen) to show comprehensive details of a selected transaction.
    * Integrated these new components into the application's navigation flow.

New Files Created


* app/src/main/java/com/koin/domain/model/Transaction.kt: Defines the Transaction data model, including details like coin ID, type (BUY/SELL), quantity, price per coin, transaction fee, timestamp, and added coin name/symbol for
  display.
* app/src/main/java/com/koin/domain/transaction/TransactionRepository.kt: Declares the TransactionRepository interface, outlining methods for fetching and adding transactions.
* app/src/main/java/com/koin/data/transaction/TransactionRepositoryImpl.kt: Provides the concrete implementation of TransactionRepository, interacting with PortfolioDao and CoinDao to manage transaction data.
* app/src/main/java/com/koin/domain/transaction/GetTransactionsUseCase.kt: Defines a use case for retrieving all transactions, abstracting the repository logic.
* app/src/main/java/com/koin/ui/transactionhistory/TransactionHistoryViewModel.kt: Manages the UI state and logic for the transaction history screen, loading and exposing transaction data.
* app/src/main/java/com/koin/ui/transactionhistory/TransactionCard.kt: A Composable function responsible for rendering a single transaction as a card, displaying key information and handling click events.
* app/src/main/java/com/koin/ui/transactiondetail/TransactionDetailViewModel.kt: Manages the UI state and logic for the transaction detail screen, fetching a specific transaction by ID.
* app/src/main/java/com/koin/ui/transactiondetail/TransactionDetailScreen.kt: The Composable screen that displays the detailed information of a single transaction.
* app/src/main/java/com/koin/ui/transactiondetail/TransactionDetailUiState.kt: Defines the UI state for the TransactionDetailScreen.
* app/src/main/java/com/koin/data/coin/CoinMappers.kt: Provides extension functions to map CoinEntity objects to Coin domain models, ensuring all relevant fields are correctly transferred.
* app/src/main/java/com/koin/di/TransactionModule.kt: A Dagger Hilt module that provides the binding for TransactionRepository to its TransactionRepositoryImpl implementation, resolving dependency injection issues.


Existing Files Modified


* app/src/main/java/com/koin/ui/coinlist/CoinListScreen.kt:
    * Updated the logic for displaying the BuySuccessBottomSheet to be driven by the CoinListUiState.
    * Modified the buy button's onClick to dispatch a ShowBuyDialog event to the ViewModel.
    * Removed local state variables (showBuyBottomSheet, selectedCoin) as their control moved to the ViewModel.
* app/src/main/java/com/koin/ui/coinlist/CoinListViewModel.kt:
    * Implemented the hideBuyDialog() and showBuyDialog() functions to handle the visibility of the buy dialog, resolving NotImplementedError.
* app/src/main/java/com/koin/ui/coinlist/BuySuccessBottomSheet.kt:
    * Enhanced the visual feedback by adding a checkmark icon to the success bottom sheet.
* app/src/main/java/com/koin/ui/portfolio/PortfolioViewModel.kt:
    * Modified the constructor to correctly inject coinRepository as a private val.
    * Refactored the buyCoin function to remove the unused pricePerCoin parameter and directly fetch the Coin object using coinRepository.getCoinById().
    * Ensured buyTransactionDetails is correctly passed to the PortfolioUiState constructor.
    * Addressed type inference issues and unresolved references for coin.name and coin.currentPrice by explicitly typing the Coin object.
* app/src/main/java/com/koin/ui/portfolio/PortfolioStates.kt:
    * Updated the BuyCoin event to remove the pricePerCoin parameter.
    * Added buyTransactionDetails as a property to the PortfolioUiState data class.
* app/src/main/java/com/koin/ui/portfolio/PortfolioScreen.kt:
    * Adjusted the onConfirm lambda for the BuyCoinDialog to align with the updated BuyCoin event signature (without pricePerCoin).
* app/src/main/java/com/koin/navigation/Screen.kt:
    * Added a new TransactionDetail route for navigating to the transaction detail screen.
* app/src/main/java/com/koin/navigation/NavGraph.kt:
    * Integrated the TransactionDetailScreen into the NavHost by adding a new composable entry for its route.
* app/src/main/java/com/koin/ui/transactionhistory/TransactionHistoryScreen.kt:
    * Updated to use TransactionHistoryViewModel to fetch and display transaction data.
    * Implemented navigation from TransactionCard clicks to the TransactionDetailScreen.
* app/src/main/java/com/koin/data/portfolio/PortfolioDao.kt:
    * Added a getAllTransactions() method to retrieve all PortfolioTransactionEntity objects, resolving an unresolved reference error in TransactionRepositoryImpl.
* app/src/main/java/com/koin/data/transaction/TransactionRepositoryImpl.kt:
    * Corrected the injection of PortfolioDao instead of the non-existent PortfolioTransactionDao.
    * Fixed the Unresolved reference 'getOrNull' error by correctly handling the Flow<CoinEntity?> returned by CoinDao.getCoinById() and using the toCoin() mapper.


These changes collectively enhance the application's functionality by providing a detailed transaction history, improving the coin purchase flow, and resolving several compilation and dependency injection issues.
